_You will need to install the most recent edition of modelsim and quartus_

- Create a new modelsim project on your machine, and add all of the files in this repository to the project
- Compile, and simulate work.lab7_top_tb and ensure that all the tests pass
- Create a new quartus project with the lab7_top file, and include lab7_top.v, alu.v, cpu.v, shifter.v, regfile.v, and datapath.v. Be sure to configure the hardware settings as appropriate for the hardware you are implementing it on
