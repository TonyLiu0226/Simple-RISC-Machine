**SIMPLE RISC MACHINE**

TO IMPLEMENT:

- Create a new modelsim project on your machine, and add all of the files in this repository to the project
- Compile, and run the lab7_top_tb simulation. Ensure that all the tests pass
- Create a new quartus project with the lab7_top file, and include all files that do not end with tb in the project files. Be sure to configure the hardware settings as appropriate for the hardware you are implementing it on
- Compile on quartus
- Download to your device, and all the functionality of the machine should work!
